# Module 2 Challenge - Loan Qualifier App

This loan qualifier app is designed to provide users an easy way to generate a list of loans and save that list as CSV file for permanent access. This will allow users to update their list daily as loan availability and requirements fluctuate. The purpose of this is to help users skip grueling phone calls with lending firms. The master list of available loans will be pulled each morning to ensure accurate and reliable qualifying loans lists.
